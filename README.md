Dialog Generator for IUP

This is a replacement for out-dated LED that generates C code for an IUP dialog.

## Features

* Use interfaces such as `IupSetCallback`, `IupSetAttributeHandle` in place of deprecated `IupSetFunction`, etc.
* Do not assign a global name to generated IUP objects, use `NAME` attribute when applicable.
* Generate pure C code, without Lua dependency.

## Status

The development has not started yet.
